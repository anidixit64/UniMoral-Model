The harm done to others as well as any mitigating circumstances, including coercion, that influenced the defendant's choice should be taken into account while determining a reasonable sentencing. Instead of concentrating only on punishment, this method enables the judge to impose a fair sentence that takes into account the complexities of the case, encourages equity, and provides for rehabilitation. While conceding that not all crimes are committed with complete autonomy, it guarantees that the defendant will be held accountable.
","Considering mitigating circumstances such as coercion, choosing Option (A) will probably result in a reduced sentence for the offender. This might encourage rehabilitation and equity, but it might also draw criticism for being overly forgiving, which could weaken the law's deterrent power and leave victims with the impression that justice was not done.
